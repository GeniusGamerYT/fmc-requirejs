### fmc-requirejs
This is the RequireJS implementation of the Flight Management Computer for GEFS Online


----
#### Testing
This allows you to run a server for GEFS from your local plugin files.

Before running this, you'll need to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org).

After doing that, open a terminal/command prompt in this directory:

 - `npm install`
 - `npm start`

Then you will be able to access the game at <http://127.0.0.1:3000/gefs.php>
